## Features

### Existing Features

User account creation.
    - User will be able to sign up with their own account, filling in a sign up form to register, login in to the site when they return and login out when they leave.

Project submission to the catalogue

- The ability to create and upload a project to the database. The user will fill out and submit a form to complete this, containing text and image data.

View a project

- The main purpose of the site, to view the projects created. A main paginated dashboard will be displayed, and then a user can load a specific project they would like to view.

Edit project information

- Ability to make changes to your own projects, but not be able to access other users projects and edit or delete them. This will be achieved by requesting the specific data form the database and displaying it in the same form to edit it.

Delete a project

- Users will have the option to delete their own projects.

### Features Left to Implement

Filtering displayed projects
    - Allow the user to filter the project by category or creator

User profile
    - Somewhere users can see content from one user, and somewhere similar the user can see all their projects submitted, to easily manage them.
